# ApiGear Studio

ApiGear Studio is a desktop application that helps you to create and manage your API projects. It is documented at [ApiGear](https://docs.apigear.io).

Studio focus on the user interface integration towards platform or external services. APIs are co-created by designers and developers. The API projects are created using [ObjectAPI](https://docs.apigear.io/docs/category/objectapi) and [technology templates](https://docs.apigear.io/docs/category/sdk-templates). The technology templates are used to generate SDKs for the API projects.

The workflow extends the API driven process with API monitoring and API simulation. This allows to create a complete API driven process with feedback loops.
